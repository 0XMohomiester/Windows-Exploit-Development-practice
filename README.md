# Buffer Overflow attack - Windows-Exploit-Development-practise 


First, I have learned How to Interact with low level programming language (Assembly), How to use Immunity Debugger to Understand the Inner-Working of the application, Second Some scripting programming language like pytho to write exploit that can exploit the vulnerability. 

I followed some resources like [corelan](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/) to understand how stack are created in the memory when the programe call function, You can check another useful resource such as [securitysift](https://www.securitysift.com/).

Then search [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/) for software that is vulnerable to that specific attack vector, then I test my new knowledge against said software. 

## Vanilla BufferOverflow (Direct EIP Overwrite).
1)[Brainpan](https://medium.com/@0XMohomiester/brainpan-1-buffer-overflow-vulnhub-machine-3d885c5cac74) VulnHube Machine.

2)Free Float FTP server HOST command.

3)PCMan FTP Server 2.07.

4)Vulnserver TRUN Command.

## SEH (Structured exception handling + Egghunting mechanism - Advaned software Exploitation).

1)Easy Chat Server 3.1.

2)Simple_Web_Server_2.2_rc2 Egghunter. 

3)Vulnserver_egghunter_GDOG command.
