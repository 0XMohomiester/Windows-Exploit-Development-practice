# Buffer Overflow Windows-Exploit-Development-practise 

First, I learned how to interact with low-level programming languages like Assembly and how to use Immunity Debugger to understand the inner workings of applications. Second, I focused on scripting languages like Python to write exploits that can target vulnerabilities.

I used resources like [corelan](https://www.corelan.be/index.php/2009/07/19/exploit-writing-tutorial-part-1-stack-based-overflows/) to understand how stacks are created in memory when a program calls functions. Another useful resource is [securitysift](https://www.securitysift.com/).

After that, I searched [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/) for software vulnerable to specific attack vectors and tested my new knowledge against those programs.

## Vanilla stack BufferOverflow (Direct EIP Overwrite).
1. [Brainpan](https://medium.com/@0XMohomiester/brainpan-1-buffer-overflow-vulnhub-machine-3d885c5cac74) VulnHube Machine.

2. Free Float FTP server HOST command.

3. PCMan FTP Server 2.07.

4. Vulnserver TRUN Command.

## SEH (Structured exception handling + egghunting mechanism - advanced software exploitation).

1. Easy Chat Server 3.1.

2. Simple_Web_Server_2.2_rc2 Egghunter. 

3. Vulnserver_egghunter_GDOG command.
